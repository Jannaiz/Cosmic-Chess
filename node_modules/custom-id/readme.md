# Custom ID

A tiny, unique but customizable,🤠 human-friendly but secure, encrypted but beautiful,🐱‍🐉intuitive string ID generator for JavaScript 🎉🎉

## Inspiration

It is built for both human and machine. We use familiar letters (from given name & email) in our randomly generated ID. **People can easily recognize those familiar letters as they use it every time, everyday, every moment.** You can randomly generate IDs with uuid or nanoid, but these are not generated for human. These are for machine. But this library is for both of them.

# Use Case

As it's human-friendly you can use it as **an OTP(one-time password), transaction ID, activation code, SMS code, Invitation key, React component key, Database random ID** etc. Your imagination is your limitation. 🎉🎉

## Installation

You can download this package from here - [custom-id npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-id)

```bash
npm i custom-id
```

Yarn installation

```bash
yarn add custom-id
```

## Usage

You can generate an ID instantly by giving **an empty object as the argument**. 👀👀👀

```js
var customId = require("custom-id");

customId({}); // Voila... A random 8 character string will be generated automatically
```

The custom ID will be generated in this format -

✌✌** 2 Number + 2 Letter + 2 Number + 2 Letter = 8 characters ** ✌✌

All those number and letter will be generated randomly. We use cryptography to generate ids (if available).

# Customizable

The most beautiful & unique advantage of this library is its **customizability**.

```js
customId({
  name: "Md. Fazlul Karim", // Optional
  email: "fazlulkarimrocky@gmail.com", // Optional
  randomLength: 2, // Optional
  lowerCase: true // Optional
});
```

## API

## customId.name (string || optional)

You can provide a name for randomization. We sanitize the string by removing space, full stop or any special characters. Then we **randomize those characters** and select required number of characters(by default 2 characters) from those characters.

If no name is provided, we just select two random alphabet.

```js
customId({
  name: "Md. Fazlul Karim" // Optional
});
```

## customId.email (string || optional)

You can provide an email too. We sanitize the email and convert it to a string by removing space or any special characters. Then we randomize those characters and select required number of characters(by default 2 characters) from those words.

If no email is provided, we just select two random alphabet.

```js
customId({
  email: "fazlulkarimrocky@gmail.com" // Optional
});
```

## customId.randomLength (number || optional)

Okay... you need flexibility too. Our by default structure is -

✌✌ 2 Number + 2 Letter + 2 Number + 2 Letter = 8 character random Id✌✌
(For example: 89KL43ZY)

We can alter this pattern too. if we pass customId.randomLength the value of 4, the result will be -

```js
customId({
  randomLength: 4 // Optional // By default it's 2
});
```

✌✌ ** 4 Number + 4 String + 4 Number + 4 String = 16 character **✌✌
(For example: 9831MKLS7621GHYX)

Power is in your hand. You can make it super strong or super easy. It's your call. Use long key combination for really important random number. And use small key combination like 4K8L for OTP or inivitaion code.

## customId.lowerCase (bool || optional)

We sanitize your string by toUpperCase() method. It's for easy readibility. So every ID created is always in uppercase format. But you may want it in lowercase format. You have the freedom. 😎😎

```js
customId({
  lowerCase: true // Optional
});
```

## customId.uniqueId ( number || Optional )

It's all about control & security. If you want to manipulate your randomly generated string, you can give an unique ID. Our encryption based algorithm will use this number to make a totally unpredictable combination of IDs. We just multiply the given number with the randomly generated number and cherrypick required characters from that multiplied number randomly. It's completely optional. You can give a static number or node js environment variable to increase unpredictabilty while generating IDs. This is how we can use both server & client machine to generate random ID. (nightmare for hackers & sniffers😂)

```js
customId({
  uniqueId: 4563 // Optional // You can provide any number
});
```

## React Use Case

![react client-id](https://i.ibb.co/THvfXW0/Screenshot-267.png)

## Example Custom ID

```js
customId({
  name: "Fazlul Karim",
  email: "fazlulkarimrocky@gmail.com"
});
```

Rendered ID will be like below -
